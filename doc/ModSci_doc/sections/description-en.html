<p class="markdown">Modern science follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe. This requires, of course, collaborations between scientists from different fields of science. For example, biologists require mathematics to process, analyze and report experimental research data and to represent relationships between some biological phenomena and statistics is used in economics in the measurement of correlation, analyzing demand and supply, forecasting through regression, interpolation and time series analysis.</p>
<p>There  are several entities (we follow the definitions found in Wikipedia)  related to such concepts:</p>
<ul>

  <li> <strong>Scientific Discovery</strong>: is the process or  product of successful scientific inquiry, which can be things, events, and  properties as well as theories and hypotheses,</li>
  <li> <strong>Phenomenon</strong>:  is something that is observed to occur or to exist,</li>
  <li> <strong>Applications  of Science</strong>: is any use of scientific knowledge for a specific purpose, whether  to do more science; to design a product, process, or medical treatment; to  develop new technology, or to predict the impacts of human actions,</li>
  <li> <strong>Scientific  Organization</strong>: is an organization that facilitates progress in a specific area  through promotion of research,</li>
  <li> <strong>Scientist</strong>:  is a person who conducts scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of  interest, and</li>
  <li> <strong>Scientific</strong> <strong>Instrument</strong>: is a device or tool used in scientific experiments for particular  purposes, such as Ammeters for measuring the current in an electric circuit.</li>
